# Detect-Object-from-Video-Capture
I developed a TensorFlow model to recognize different objects in videos. The model processes uploaded videos, detects and classifies various objects in each frame, providing real-time object recognition. This project demonstrates the ability to analyze dynamic visual data for applications in surveillance, automation, and more.
