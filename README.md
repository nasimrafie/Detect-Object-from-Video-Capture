# Detect-Object-from-Video-Capture
I developed a TensorFlow model using **MobileNetV2** to recognize different objects in videos. The model processes uploaded videos, detects and classifies various objects in each frame, providing real-time object recognition. This project demonstrates the power of MobileNetV2 for efficient object detection in dynamic visual data.
